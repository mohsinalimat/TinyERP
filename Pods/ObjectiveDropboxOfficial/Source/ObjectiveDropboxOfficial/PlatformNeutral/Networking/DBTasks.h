///
/// Base class for network task wrappers.
///
/// After a network request is made via `DBTransportClient`, a subclass
/// of `DBTask` is returned, from which response and progress handlers
/// can be installed, and the network response paused or cancelled.
///
/// Handlers are executed on the thread specified by the `DBDelegate` instance with which
/// the `DBTask` instance is initialied (more specifically, the delegate queue that
/// the `DBDelegate` uses to execute handler code). By default, this is the main
/// thread, which makes updating UI elements in response handlers convenient.
///
/// While response handlers are not optional, they do not necessarily need to have been installed
/// by the time the SDK has received its server response. If this is the case, completion data will
/// be saved, and the handler will be executed with the completion data upon its installation.
/// Downloaded content will be moved from a temporary location to the final destination when the
/// response handler code is executed.
